# Blinken

## Development Setup

To ease installation, it is suggested you install and run with Vagrant. However, if you do not wish to use Vagrant (Disk Space or Stubbornness), the Vagrant configuration in no way inhibits you from doing so.

### With Vagrant

Vagrant is a portable environment that removes the hassle of aligning your local environment with the needs of the application. This will normally allow you to get started with development extremely fast. This is also ideal if you work on multiple projects, as tweaking your environment for one application while often result in another breaking. Vagrant is cross-platform, so Blinken can be ran effortlessly on Windows, Mac and Linux.
